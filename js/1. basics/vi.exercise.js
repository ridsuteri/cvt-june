// You are given an array of student objects. Each student has the following properties:

// name (string): The student's name

// score (number): The score obtained in the exam (out of 100)

// passed (boolean): Whether the student passed the exam or not (pass mark is 40+)

// Your tasks are to:

// âœ… Use filter() to get an array of all students who passed the exam.

// ðŸ“ˆ Use map() to get an array of strings in the format: "Alice scored 87 marks."

// ðŸ§® Use reduce() to calculate the average score of all students.
